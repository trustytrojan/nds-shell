### Small script tests
- `.ndsh_history` is the line history file. It is loaded on shell startup.
- `.ndshrc` is equivalent to `.bashrc` for Bash. It is run on shell startup.
- `source-test.ndsh` is for testing the "shell scripts are commands" functionality, and using the `source` command itself.
- `test.lua` is for testing the `lua <file>` command.
