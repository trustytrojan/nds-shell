## Synopsis
Although it may seem like it, the scope of this project is *not* to be an operating system. That has been attempted several times before, not to mention the existence of [DSLinux](https://www.dslinux.org/), which has been long abandoned. Thanks to the [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) team, turning the DS into a general-purpose computer is a lot easier than it was back then. That's what this project aims to do: make the work of [libnds](https://github.com/devkitPro/libnds) fully interactive, while adding some fun features on top!

## Features
- `sh`-like features: cursor navigation, I/O redirection, environment variables, variable substitution, command history
- Filesystem manipulation using typical POSIX-like commands: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, etc
- Networking commands: `wifi`, `dns`, `tcp`, `curl`
- Lua interpreter (soon an API to add custom commands)
- HTTPS/SSL support with cURL and MbedTLS!
  - HUGE thanks to [this blogpost](https://git.vikingsoftware.com/blog/libcurl-with-mbedtls) for figuring out the CMake quirks

## Dependencies
- [libnds](https://github.com/devkitPro/libnds), which includes [dswifi](https://github.com/devkitPro/dswifi) and [libfat](https://github.com/devkitPro/libfat)
- [MbedTLS (my fork)](https://github.com/trustytrojan/mbedtls/tree/3.6.4-nds)
- [cURL (my fork)](https://github.com/trustytrojan/curl/tree/8.15.0-mbedtls)
- [Lua](https://lua.org)
- [sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2)

## Building
*note: this process has only been tested on linux*

1. Get [devkitPro pacman](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) on your system
2. Install the `nds-dev` metapackage (explained in the link above)
3. Run `$DEVKITPRO/tools/bin/catnip -Tnds -j$(nproc)`
	- **Do NOT run CMake. You must run `catnip`.**

## To-do list (will be converted to issues)
- a way to push files to the DS remotely (try FTP with curl)
- use an argument parsing library for commands
